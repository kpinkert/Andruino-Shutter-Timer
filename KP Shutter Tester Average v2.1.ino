/*

    I want to give credit to the YouTube fellow CAMERADACTYL Cameras who wrote the initial code that I started with.
    
    Everyone has their own programming style. I spent almost 40 years coding with most of it dealing with interfacing 
    with hardware. ISR routines have some coding rules that help keep multi-threading safer. All of the critical timing
    components to the formula for shutter speed calculations are done in the ISR here. Mainly for reliability and
    also to keep the Andurino code base for adding in extra overhead, if possible.

    One other feature I added was the ability to average a specific number of consecutive shutter clicks. The program
    defaults to 5 clicks. But that can be changed to go from 1 (no averaging), to however many you feel like doing.
    To change the number of snaps used for averaging, just change the value in the #define AVERAGES

    Another feature that I added was the ability to use a "UCTRONICS 0.96 Inch OLED Module 12864". This allows the
    Adruino setup to be used with without a serial connection for logging data. Perhaps running off of a 9 volt battery.
    This UCTRONICS feature can be used at the same time as the serial interface. And it can also be turned off
    completely to keep from getting compile errors. Just comment out the #define UCTRONICS line of code at the top
    of this file.

  // toggles states

  // Sensor state LOW : Laser goes on and sensor changes states to LOW.
  // Sensor state HIGH: Laser goes off and sensor goes back to HIGH, it's idle state.

  // get the state of the laser sensor. This the resulting state from the CHANGE ISR interrupt.
  // In other words: the timeline for the sensor change is : Start to go to a new state, fire off the interrupt,
  // and by the time the ISR is given control, the sensor state has settled into the new state.
